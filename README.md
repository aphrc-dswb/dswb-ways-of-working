The Data Science Without Borders (DSWB) Ways of Working document is a guideline for the community and enthusiasts on what we do, how we work, the various roles and responsibilities of community members, and our methods of communication. It also includes our schedule, resources, and community diversity guidelines.   

## Vision and Mission

- **Vision:** Our vision is to foster best practices in data, making them in the open, encouraging collaboration, participation and community, while creating sustainability for these practices. 
- **Mission:** Our mission is to create and strengthen data systems, while implementing open source/science best practices and nurture systems that run instinctively on these practices.

## About

Data Science Without Borders (DSWB) is an international initiative, funded by the Wellcome Trust and led by the African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC). This project has three overarching objectives: to strengthen data systems in Pathfinder countries, to create a sustainable environment for collaborative AI/ML platforms, and to create a user-friendly platform for AI and Machine Learning (AI/ML) tools. The impact of inequality in data availability and access is evident, particularly in resource-limited settings like many African nations. This African institution-led initiative will leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) to bridge existing gaps in data accessibility, infrastructure, and expertise. It aims to foster a collaborative environment that empowers African nations to harness the full potential of AI/ML for improving health outcomes.
