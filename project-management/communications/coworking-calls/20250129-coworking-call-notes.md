### Things we worked on

   1. Plans for the AGM meeting - Hackathonwise: Due to the limited time Malvika mentioned planning for a hackathon would not provide expected results, and suggested instead using the meeting to learn about challenges faced in various demographics. These challenges in the long run, would form the basis of the solutions that hackathons in the future would be  built on. 
   1. Partnerships that would be beneficial to executing these hackathons and ideas from the data study group were mentioned, and a few individuals and organisations were suggested to be reached out to. Some of which are: 
       * Angela Okune for direct collaboration on hackathon/data study group format
           * Her project collects AI tools for infectious diseases
       * Curate workshop ideas from DLI: [https://deeplearningindaba.com/2024/workshops/](https://deeplearningindaba.com/2024/workshops/)
