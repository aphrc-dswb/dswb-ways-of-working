## Notes

   * Pauline does not have coworking on her calendar/email.

**From Breakout Rooms:**

**Room 1:**
   * Need sufficient time to review documents.
   * French speakers might have difficulty reading the documents.
     
**Room 2**
   * Missing Data Handling - Need for more illustrations,
   * Include content on how to handle outliers
   * General overview - Table of content seems sufficient(has incorporated most of the previous discussions that would be helpful for the different pathfinder sites) - Need to go through the resources
