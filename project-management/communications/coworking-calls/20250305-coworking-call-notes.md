## Notes

   * Data to be shared on Github would be metadata, and visualizations. Information that share about the data without too much information. 
       * Sensitive data should NOT be shared on GitHub
       * Link to enable gitignore on local repository: [https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) 
   * It is a great chance to look at the Data Sharing Agreement to know what kind of data can be shared, and should be protected.
       * All members of the community should read it to understand what kinds of data they can make public, and the kinds they cannot.
   * Raw data should always be anonymised.
   * Metadata is important to be shared, and it has a standard to be shared.
       * The OMOP standard.
   * A seperate agreement should be made if data would be shared with others.
   * AI: Remove data from our template and data folder so members are not confused.
   * Miranda - Based on Data Sharing Agreement: 
       * Only share codes for the analysis
       * Don't share data on GitHub especially as the DSA hasn't been actualised yet.
       * Only share dummy data.
       * Data sharing agreements within partners should follow the same vein as the exisitng DSA agreement, but there should be partner to partner agreement on how they'd prefer their data should be treated.
       * There should be definitions of what we consider metadata, and where to share them. 
           * Also define what is out of scope. 
           * Define what is provided data, shared data, derived data.
           * Resources:
               * [https://book.the-turing-way.org/project-design/sdp/metadata](https://book.the-turing-way.org/project-design/sdp/metadata), 
               * [https://book.the-turing-way.org/project-design/sdp](https://book.the-turing-way.org/project-design/sdp) 
   * Data to be shared should first be approved by the contact person
   * Notes from AGM
       * Feedback One: 
           * Working on the schedule earlier, and ensuring ease of session flow
           * Would be nice to see more stuff on open science, and data science innovation.
           * We were able to see potential for partnerships.
           * We learned from discussions around skills building and learning. We have a lot of work ahead, and it is exciting to see.
       * Feedback Two:
           * AGM was good in terms of organization.
           * More presentaton from the technical partners/external stakeholders so we have an idea what they are doing.
           * More time to network and learn from each other.
       * Feedback Three:
           * It was great.
           * More time to have all partners speak.
       * Feedback Four:

       * Members were encouraged to suggest what topics could be removed from the curated chapters: [https://deploy-preview-4043--the-turing-way.netlify.app/data-science-without-borders](https://deploy-preview-4043--the-turing-way.netlify.app/data-science-without-borders) 
       * Data report can be shared as data journals, or micro papers.
       * After inputting missing chapters in the curated pathway, we would work on creating executable files as case studies.
       * We do have README file template, as well as repository template
       * We also have a chapter on missing data handling
       * We are interested in writing different kinds of publications so the chapter on data and software papers should be added
       * Remove data hazard chapter for now, that is not essential for people starting out
   * How to give addition review and feedback beyond these meetings
   * Book Dash dates and plans for developing missing resources
   * Stakeholder mapping and communication strategy for ensuring open working in DSWB
       * Presenting the first iteration of the stakeholder map: [https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLgVaxak=/](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLgVaxak=/)
       * Identify who is missing and what communications channels we could be using but aren't currently.
       * Shared the Miro Board via email so others can edit and add their own ideas.
   * Binderhub for Luc
       * Share resource as he left the call midway.
   * Binderhub is similar to google collab.
