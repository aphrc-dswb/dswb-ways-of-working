   * Data report can be shared as data journals, or micro papers.
   * After inputting missing chapters in the curated pathway, we would work on creating executable files as case studies.
   * We do have README file template, as well as repository template
   * We also have a chapter on missing data handling
   * We are interested in writing different kinds of publications so the chapter on data and software papers should be added
   * Remove data hazard chapter for now, that is not essential for people starting out
